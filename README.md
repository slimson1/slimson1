# Hello ðŸ‘‹, welcome to my GitHub profile!

My name is Sam. I'm from London and I'm currently participating in a web development boot camp with HyperionDev.

Right now, I'm working on tasks to build my skills and help me pass the course. **Stay tuned though!** I plan on making some exciting projects soon.
So far my learning has been focused on HTML, CSS and JS. It's just the basics, but we _all_ start somewhere, right?

During the day I have a sales role in legal services and have a background in property, finance and insurance. I hope to intergrate my experaince with the new skills I am learning.

Let's connect! I'm new here and it will be great to get to know you.
